This is a monorepo containing packages for the models & logic of the werewolf game, as well as the translations and resuable components for a web frontend.
Currently the only application using these is a simple react web frontend which runs the games logic locally in the browser. There are plans to reuse this logic for...

- an online variant which runs the game on a server which multiple players can join
- a discord bot running games in the chat
- a react-native app similar to the current standalone frontend

## Contribution

Since this project is in it's early phases, a lot of conceptual work is yet to be done and contributing to the source code may not be reasonable yet in most cases.

## Translating

There is a [Weblate Project][TRANSLATE] which handles translations for the files found under `packages/locale/` and contributing here is much appreciated.
